# Krysia Janik - homepage 

One on very first webpack projects, created as part of course "WTF: Co Ten Frontend"

## How to access?

Wepage is in Polish only. It's published on github pages [here](https://krysiajanik.github.io/homepage-webpack/).

## What to discover?

I heartily recommend the **meme** section. Even though it was only updated initially, in the first weeks of the WTF course, it still cracks me up every time.

The **homework** section was initially designed as a playground for less comprehensive homeworks, as in "play with grid" or "give google fonts a go".

I will definitely not be updating the **diary** section, as, let's be honest, no one wants to read that and it's not remotely entertaining.
